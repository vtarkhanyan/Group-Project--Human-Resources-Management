In this project, we will have a home page.
On the home page, we will be able to see the department of the organization, the employee, the employee's role, salary, and report. Every section should have a subsection. 
We can add departments and employees, calculate salaries, audit employees' salaries, generate tax reports, contracts, orders, references on average salaries, and slips of employee payments.
